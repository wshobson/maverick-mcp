"""Backtest signal definitions against historical OHLCV data.

Bridges :mod:`maverick_mcp.services.signals.conditions` (the live
evaluation engine) and :mod:`maverick_mcp.backtesting` (the vectorbt-based
strategy framework) so a user can validate a signal definition against
history before deploying it.

Design constraint: behavior must match live evaluation exactly. The
adapter walks the OHLCV frame bar by bar and calls
:func:`evaluate_condition` at each step, propagating ``previous_state``
across iterations. This is O(n) but correct for stateful operators
(``crosses_above`` / ``crosses_below``) and trivially correct for the
stateless ones — at the cost of being slower than a pure-vectorized
implementation. The trade-off is intentional and per spec.
