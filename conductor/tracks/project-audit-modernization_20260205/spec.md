# Specification: Project Audit & Modernization

**Track ID:** project-audit-modernization_20260205
**Type:** Chore
**Created:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Planning

## Summary

Produce a repo-grounded assessment of MaverickMCP's current implementation quality and a modernization roadmap aligned with the latest Model Context Protocol (MCP) + FastMCP ecosystem.

## Scope

- **This track is recommendations-only**: no refactors/behavior changes are implemented as part of this track.
- Output should be actionable: concrete first steps, sequencing, and “golden path” decisions to enable a follow-on implementation track/session.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Written audit covering: architecture, strengths, weaknesses, and hotspots (with file references)
- [ ] Refactor recommendations prioritized by impact/risk (with suggested sequencing)
- [ ] Research summary of current MCP/FastMCP capabilities and relevant recent changes
- [ ] Modernization roadmap mapping research findings to concrete repo actions
- [ ] Scope explicitly states no code changes are included in this track
