# Implementation Plan: Project Audit & Modernization

**Track ID:** project-audit-modernization_20260205
**Spec:** [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Created:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** [ ] Planning

## Overview

This track focuses on understanding and improving the long-term maintainability of MaverickMCP. Work is primarily research + documentation: a repo audit, a review of the current MCP/FastMCP ecosystem, and a prioritized modernization/refactor plan. No behavior changes are expected unless explicitly called out as optional "quick wins."

## Start Here Next Session (Safe Wins First)

These are the first steps to execute when you begin implementation work:

1. **Pick the golden path** (single supported server entrypoint + transport for Claude Desktop).
2. **Remove/relocate global side effects** (centralize `logging.basicConfig()` and `load_dotenv()` into a single bootstrap path).
3. **Re-evaluate FastMCP transport behavior** after upgrading within stable 2.x to see if the SSE trailing-slash monkey-patch can be removed.
4. **Deprecate alternate router variants** by choosing canonical routers and adding a migration/deprecation note.
5. **Adopt background tasks** for long-running tools (deep research/backtests) where it improves responsiveness and reduces timeouts.

## Phase 1: Repo Audit (Local)

### Tasks

- [x] Task 1.1: Confirm the “golden path” decision (transport + entrypoint) (c4c366a)
- [x] Task 1.2: Identify and document what becomes “legacy” (c4c366a)
- [x] Task 1.3: Produce a refactor sequencing plan (P0/P1/P2) (c4c366a)

## Phase 2: MCP/FastMCP Research (External)

### Tasks

- [x] Task 2.1: Validate MCP transport guidance (spec/changelog) for this use case (ba98fce)
- [x] Task 2.2: Validate FastMCP capabilities to leverage (background tasks, sampling) (ba98fce)

## Phase 3: Modernization Roadmap

### Tasks

- [ ] Task 3.1: Define “safe wins” to do first (no behavior changes)
- [ ] Task 3.2: Define an implementation track plan (TDD tasks + verification)
- [ ] Task 3.3: Create an explicit deprecation plan for alternate paths

### Verification

- [ ] Deliverables completed (audit + research + roadmap)
- [ ] LLM Judge: N/A (no harness configured)
